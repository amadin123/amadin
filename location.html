                <p>The Cree are one of the largest tribes in Canada. Their territory covers a vast area of Western Canada from the Hudson-James Bay
                    region to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and in Alberta between the North banks of the North Saskatchewan River to Fort Chipewyan.
                    This includes the Beaver, Athabasca and peace Rivers basins. It is noted in the Department of Indian Affairs Annual Reports that

                    <p>haida are an Indigenous group who have traditionally occupied Haida Gwaii, an archipelago just off the coast of British Columbia,
                         Canada, for at least 12,500 years. The Haida are known for their craftsmanship, trading skills, and seamanship.</p>

                         <p>Canadian Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec,
                            Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories and Yukon (traditionally), particularly
                            around the Arctic Ocean, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.[a] These areas are known, primarily by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, as
                            Inuit Nunangat.[11][12] In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of
                            Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the Métis</p>

                            <p> Mi’kmaq are Indigenous peoples who are among the original inhabitants in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada.
                                 Alternative names for the Mi’kmaq appear in some historical sources and include Gaspesians, Souriquois and
                                Tarrantines. Contemporary Mi’kmaq communities are located predominantly in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
                                  but with a significant presence in Quebec, Newfoundland, Maine and the Boston area. In the 2021 census, 70,640 
                                  people claimed Mi’kmaw ancestry. In July 2022, the Mi'kmaq language was recognized as the first language of Nova

                                     <p>The Mohawk are traditionally the keepers of the Eastern Door of the Iroquois Confederacy, also known as
                                         the Six Nations Confederacy or the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Our original homeland is the north eastern

                                          <p>The Ojibwe stretch from present-day Ontario in eastern Canada all the way into Montana. Oral traditions
                                             of the Ojibwe, Ottawa, and Potawatomi assert that at one time all three tribes were one people who lived
                                              at the Straits of Mackinac. From there, they split off into three different groups. Linguistic, archaeological, 
                                              and historical evidence suggests that the three tribes do indeed descend from a common ethnic origin. The three
                                               languages are almost identical. The Ojibwe call themselves "Anishinaabeg," which means the "True People" or the
                                               "Original People." Other Indians and Europeans called them "Ojibwe" or "Chippewa," which meant "puckered up,"
                                                probably because the Ojibwe traditionally wore moccasins with a puckered seam across the top.</p>

                                                <p>The Niitsitapi, also known as the Blackfoot or Blackfeet Indians, reside in the Great Plains of Montana and the 
                                                    Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.[citation needed] Originally, only one of the Niitsitapi tribes
                                                     was called Blackfoot or Siksika. The name is said to have come from the color of the peoples' moccasins, made
                                                      of leather. They had typically dyed or painted the soles of their moccasins black. One legendary story claimed
                                                       that the Siksika walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored the bottoms of their moccasins
                                                        black.[citation needed]</p>
