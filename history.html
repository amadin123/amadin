                <p>Name Origin: The name "Cree" comes from the French traders'<br> name for the James Bay band, "Kristineaux."
                    - Pre-colonial<br> History: The Cree people were hunters and gatherers, and their<br> social structure was based on small bands of related families.
                    - Fur<br> Trade: The Cree people were involved in the fur trade and acquired<br> firearms, which helped them expand their territory.
                    - Colonial Contact:<br> The Cree people first contacted Europeans in 1682, and later encounters<br> were often friendly, but also led to the introduction of smallpox, which<br> decimated their population.
                    - Treaties and Reservations: The Cree people<br> signed treaties with the Canadian government, which led to the establishment<br> of reservations.
                    - Modern-Day: Today, the Cree people are one of the<br> largest Indigenous groups in Canada, with over 350,000 people bearing<br> Cree ancestry.
                    - Culture: The Cree people have a rich culture, with their<br> own language, traditions, and customs, such as the Sun Dance and the<br> Walking Out ceremony.
                    - Language: The Cree language belongs to the <br>Algonquian language family and is still spoken by many Cree people<br> today.
                    - Population: According to the 2021 census, 223,745 people<br> identified as having Cree ancestry, and 86,475 people speak Cree languages.</p>

                <img src="image/4.jpg" width="400px">
                <p>Haida history begins with the arrival of the primordial ancestresses of the Haida<br> matrilineages in Haida Gwaii some 14,000 to 19,000 years
                     ago. These include<br> SGuuluu Jaad (Foam Woman), Jiila Kuns (Creek Woman), and KalGa Jaad<br> (Ice woman).[8] The Haida canon of oral histories
                      and archaeological findings<br> agree that Haida ancestors lived alongside glaciers and were present at the time<br> of the arrival of the first
                       tree, a lodgepole pine, on Haida Gwaii.[9] For thousands<br> of years since Haida have participated in a rigorous coast-wide legal system
                        called<br> Potlatch. After the Island's wide arrival of red cedar some 7,500 years ago Haida<br> society transformed to centre around the coastal 
                        "tree of life". Massive carved cedar<br> monuments and cedar big houses became widespread throughout Haida Gwaii</p>

                        <p>Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule people,<br> who emerged from the Bering Strait and western Alaska around
                             1000<br> CE. They had split from the related Aleut group about 4000 years ago<br> and from northeastern Siberian migrants. They spread eastward
                             across<br> the Arctic</p>

                             <img src="image/6.jpg" width="400px">
                             <p>The Mi’kmaq were perhaps the first American Indian people on the North<br> American continent to be contacted, first by the Vikings and then
                                 by John<br> Cabot in 1497. First colonized by the French, the Mi’kmaq were converted<br> to Catholicism by the Jesuits beginning in 1611. A 
                                 traditional enemy was<br> the Maliseet, called the Ejemin, with whom the Mi’kmaq frequently fought.<br> Alongside their French allies, the
                                  Mi’kmaq defeated and incorporated another<br> traditional enemy, the Beothuk of Newfoundland. Later, along with the other<br> members of
                                   the Wabanaki Confederacy (Penobscot Abenaki, Passamaquoddy,<br> Maliseet) and the French, the Mi’kmaq fought the British and their allies
                                    the<br> Iroquois. Following the French defeat, the Mi’kmaq military leadership and<br> many other Mi’kmaq went to Cape Breton Island, which
                                     remained French until<br> 1763. During the American Revolution, the Mi’kmaq allied themselves with<br> the Americans. After that war, the 
                                     Mi’kmaq became itinerant peddlers, and the<br> British established Indian reserves at traditional Mi’kmaq meeting places.</p>

                                     <p>The Mohawk are traditionally the keepers of the Eastern Door of the Iroquois<br> Confederacy, also known as the Six Nations Confederacy 
                                        or the Haudenosaunee<br> Confederacy. Our original homeland is the north eastern region of New York<br>State extending into southern Canada 
                                        and Vermont. Prior to contact with<br> Europeans the Mohawk settlements populated the Mohawk Valley of New York<br> State. Through the
                                         centuries Mohawk influence extended far beyond their<br> territory and was felt by the Dutch who settled on the Hudson River and in<br>
                                          Manhattan. The Mohawks’ location as the Iroquois nation closest to Albany and<br> Montreal, and the fur traders there, gave them
                                           considerable influence among the<br> other Tribes. This location has also contributed directly to a long and beautifully<br> complicated
                                           history.

                                     <p>The ancestors of the Ojibwe lived throughout the northeastern part of North<br> America and along the Atlantic Coast. Due to a combination of
                                         prophecies<br> and tribal warfare, around 1,500 years ago the Ojibwe people left their<br> homes along the ocean and began a slow migration westward
                                         that lasted<br> for many centuries</p>
                                         <p>he Ojibwe have always hunted and fished, made maple sugar and syrup,<br> and harvested wild rice. Prior to the 20th century, the Ojibwe lived<br>
                                             in wigwams and travelled the waterways of the region in birch bark canoes.<br> Ojibwe communities were historically based on clans, or "doodem,"
                                             which<br> determined a person's place in Ojibwe society. Different clans represented <br>different aspects of Ojibwe society; for example, political 
                                             leaders came<br> from the loon or crane clans, while warriors were traditionally from the bear,<br> martin, lynx, and wolf clans. Ojibwe theology 
                                             centers on a belief in a single<br> creating force but also incorporates a wide pantheon of spirits that play<br> specific roles in the universe.

                                         <p>At one time, they were feared Plains warriors. Historians believe the Blackfeet,<br> forced out of their ancestral grounds in today’s upper Great
                                             Lakes region by<br> white advancement, were one of the first Native American tribes to head West.<br> Though there are several stories on how they 
                                             received their name, the most<br> plausible is that their moccasins were blackened from the long journey across<br> the prairie to reach what would
                                              become Montana.</p>

                                                The Blackfeet band now living on the<br> Blackfeet Reservation are descendants of the Piegan branch of the Blackfeet. <br>Two other bands – the 
                                                Bloods and the North Blackfeet – now reside on<br> Canadian Indian preserves scattered throughout Alberta.

                                                  use pishkuns – steep cliffs over which herds of bison were driven <br>for harvesting.</p>
